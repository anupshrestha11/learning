# How to think like a genius programmer

### 1. **Backbox Method**
The blackbox method: let's say you need to develop some code that takes in two lists and outputs the merged results of these two lists. A good programmer will immediately think of two things: how to test this code and how to scale. Notice how we haven't actually implemented any code yet. This is what the blackbox method is. Essentially, we know the inputs and outputs of our code, but we deliberately don't worry about the internal workings just yet. By treating your code as a blackbox, you have clear expectations for what the code should do. For example, if I give it two lists, one containing [1, 3, 5] and the other [2, 4, 6], the output should be [1 through 6]. How the code achieves this isn't important at this stage, but what matters is that it takes these inputs and reliably produces the correct output. This method helps create test cases with edge scenarios and is essential to help modularize and scale your code. Thinking in terms of blackboxes allows you to break the system into independent parts that interact with each other.

### 2. **Collaboration**
Collaboration isn't just a soft skill; it's a core skill for any successful programmer. For example, if you need to come up with an algorithm that's going to be reused in other parts of the codebase, you can't just write it in isolation and call it a day. You need to think about how this algorithm will fit into the existing system, how it will interact with other components, and how your team members will use it. You're not just writing code for yourself; you're writing it for your team. Ensure your code is clean, well-documented, and easy to understand. Make sure to use meaningful names, follow coding conventions, and use comments. Your code should be easy for your teammates to understand without needing a deep dive. Also, consider how your coding decisions might impact the team in the long run. Will it be easy to update or extend in the future?

### 3. **Improve the Wheel**
A good programmer knows when to use other code for their advantage. If you need to develop a user authentication system, you could spend weeks developing it from scratch, but why do that when there are countless well-tested libraries and frameworks like OAuth or JWT that have already solved this problem? It’s not about being lazy; it’s about being smart. Your time and energy should be spent on the parts of the project that truly require your unique input. However, using other code doesn't mean blindly copying and pasting without understanding it. You should always take the time to learn the tools you're working with, so you're building a deep understanding of the systems. Using tools exposes you to industry standards and new ways of thinking, allowing you to integrate different components and make informed decisions.

---

### 4. **Use Other Code**
When I say use other code, I don’t mean using ChatGPT to write your entire project. If you're building something like a user authentication system, instead of reinventing the wheel, use well-established libraries like OAuth or JWT. They have solved these problems in a well-tested way. Learning how to use these tools doesn’t just make you faster—it makes you more adaptable. You're also learning how to read and understand other people's code and how to make decisions about which tools are right for the job.

---

### 5. **Use Tools**
Use tools to your advantage. As a programmer, your time and energy are valuable, so it’s smart to utilize libraries and frameworks. But it’s important to understand these tools, not just copy and paste without knowledge. Using tools helps you integrate industry standards, learn new concepts, and adapt to different programming environments. It’s not about being lazy; it’s about working efficiently and effectively.

---

### 6. **Think in Terms of Process**
If you're a beginner, you've probably spent most of your time mastering one or two programming languages. But what happens when you need to learn a new one? The key is to think in terms of processes rather than just code. Programming is about more than writing loops or functions in Python—it's about understanding the underlying concepts and methodologies that are used everywhere. Before writing code, think about the process. For example, if you're asked to build a feature that sorts a list of items, don't jump straight into coding. Think about the most efficient way to sort the data and consider the trade-offs between different sorting algorithms. The same applies to data structures—understand what to use and when. By focusing on the process first, converting it into code becomes much easier.

---

### 7. **Understand the Underlying Concepts**
When you focus only on specific programming languages, you limit yourself. Programming is about understanding the underlying concepts that can be applied universally. For example, before jumping into coding, you should ask yourself what data structures, algorithms, or methodologies will be the most efficient and effective. Understanding the process behind solving a problem is key to becoming a good programmer. This way, you can adapt your knowledge to different programming languages and environments.

---

### 8. **Failure is Valuable**
Failure in programming is not just inevitable; it’s valuable. Every error, bug, or failure is an opportunity to learn. Everyone, at every level, makes mistakes—it’s impossible to write perfect code all the time. Instead of viewing failure as a setback, you should see it as feedback. When something goes wrong, it's a chance to understand your code better and improve it. Failure is part of the process of becoming a better programmer. The ability to learn from these mistakes and continuously improve is what makes a successful programmer.

### 1. **Blackbox Method**
The **blackbox method** is a key approach in programming. Let’s say you need to develop code that merges two lists into one. A good programmer will focus on two things before coding: how to test it and how to scale it. At this stage, we don’t worry about the internal workings of the code—we only focus on the inputs and expected outputs. This is the essence of the blackbox method: we know what we’re putting in and what we want to get out, but we deliberately ignore the details of how it works internally for now.

This approach helps in several ways:
- **Clarity**: You define clear expectations for what the code should achieve.
- **Testing**: It allows you to create test cases, including edge scenarios (like empty lists or repeated elements).
- **Modularity**: It encourages breaking down complex systems into smaller, independent parts that interact through well-defined inputs and outputs. 

The blackbox method is essentially a form of **abstraction**, which is crucial for managing complexity and scaling your code. By not getting bogged down in details early on, you can focus on the big picture and adapt more easily later on.

### 2. **Collaboration**
Collaboration is not just a soft skill—it's essential to being a successful programmer. If you need to create an algorithm that will be reused in different parts of a codebase, you can’t do it in isolation. You need to think about:
- **Integration**: How your algorithm fits into the existing system and interacts with other components.
- **Team Use**: How your teammates will understand and maintain the code in the future.

To ensure successful collaboration:
- Write **clean**, **well-documented**, and **easy-to-understand** code.
- Use **meaningful names**, follow **coding conventions**, and write **helpful comments**.
  
Remember, you’re not coding just for yourself. You’re coding for your team, and the more understandable and maintainable your code is, the more effective you’ll be as a programmer.

### 3. **Improve the Wheel**
Good programmers know when to use existing solutions instead of creating everything from scratch. For example, if you need to build a user authentication system, why spend weeks developing it when there are many well-tested libraries and frameworks (like OAuth or JWT) available?

It’s not about laziness—it’s about being smart and efficient. As a programmer, your time and energy should be spent on solving unique, complex problems rather than reinventing the wheel. 

However, using existing code doesn’t mean blindly copying and pasting. You should:
- Understand how these tools work under the hood.
- Learn from industry standards and expose yourself to new ways of thinking.

By using existing tools and libraries, you can integrate industry standards while still building a deep understanding of the systems.

---

### 4. **Use Other Code**
When I say use other code, I’m not talking about using AI to write your entire project. Instead, take advantage of well-established libraries and frameworks that solve common problems. For instance, for user authentication, libraries like **OAuth** or **JWT** are already proven and reliable.

By using such tools, you’re not just saving time—you’re also:
- Learning how to integrate different components.
- Exposing yourself to new techniques.
  
This makes you more adaptable and efficient as a programmer.

---

### 5. **Use Tools**
Using tools like libraries and frameworks doesn’t mean you’re lazy—it’s a smart way to approach problem-solving. Tools allow you to focus on the parts of the project that require your creativity and unique input. Always make sure to **learn** how these tools work, so you understand how they fit into your project.

This approach:
- Saves time and effort.
- Helps you learn **industry standards**.
- Makes you better at reading, understanding, and integrating code from different sources.

---

### 6. **Think in Terms of Processes**
As you advance in programming, you’ll likely start by mastering one or two languages. But what happens when you need to learn a new language? The key is to think in terms of **processes** rather than specific code or syntax.

Programming isn’t just about writing loops or functions in one language—it’s about understanding the underlying **concepts** and **methodologies** that apply across all languages. Before you write code, think about the **process**:
- What’s the best way to solve this problem?
- What’s the most efficient algorithm or data structure?

Once you understand the process, writing the code becomes much easier, and you’ll be able to adapt your knowledge to any language.

---

### 7. **Understand the Underlying Concepts**
Focusing solely on the specifics of one or two languages can limit you as a programmer. Instead, work on understanding the **fundamental concepts** and **methodologies** that can be applied universally. 

For example:
- When asked to create a class for inserting and removing elements, think about the best **data structures** to use, given the requirements.
  
This way, regardless of the programming language, you can adapt your knowledge and create solutions efficiently. Understanding these foundational concepts is key to becoming a good programmer.

---

### 8. **Failure is Valuable**
Failure in programming is inevitable, but it’s also incredibly valuable. Every bug, error, or failed solution is an opportunity to learn. No one writes perfect code all the time.

Instead of seeing failure as a setback, view it as **feedback**. Each failure helps you:
- **Understand your code** better.
- **Improve** your future solutions.

This mindset is critical because programming is all about problem-solving. Mistakes are not a roadblock—they’re a learning opportunity. To become a great programmer, embrace failure as part of the process and continuously improve your skills.
